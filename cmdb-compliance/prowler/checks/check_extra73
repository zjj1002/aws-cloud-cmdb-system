# Verified with AWS support that if get-bucket-acl doesn't return a grant
# for All and get-bucket-policy-status returns IsPublic false or bad request
# (no policy) then the bucket can be considered not public - though
# individual objects may still be. If in addition put-public-access-block is
# used to set IgnorePublicAcls and RestrictPublicBuckets to true then that
# causes Amazon S3 to ignore all public ACLs on a bucket and any objects that
# it contains.
#
# This check does not address legacy ACLs or policies that would give
# public access if not blocked at account or bucket level, instead it tries
# to reward the use of more broadly restrictive controls with quicker and less
# computational intensive checks.
#
# If we are assembling an inventory then maybe that is not what we want but
# for day to day usage that is probably desirable.
